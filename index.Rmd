## Five Minute Dungeon Experiments  
A set of code, experimentation, and data to explore the power of teams, design thinking, and statistics in R.  

### Data  
Weekly experiments and data collected by teams.  

```{r, data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#install.packages("tidyverse") #only need to do this once then mute it with #
library(tidyverse)
data <- read_csv(url("http://bit.ly/5MD_DOWNLOAD_2")) #read from web for updates but can load locally too
data

```

### Viz  
```{r, viz, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(players, time)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
  xlim(c(2,5)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm)

ggplot(data, aes(time, joy)) +
  geom_point(size = 4) +
   geom_smooth(method = lm)

```

### Models
```{r, models, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
t.test(data$time, mu = 0)

```

### Interpretations  
1. Larger teams are not necessarily more effective.  
2. Time and joy not related but might be better to test won-lost as response.
